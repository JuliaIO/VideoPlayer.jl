This repository is useful if you want to create your own test video. The one here has a variable frame rate of 41 FPS for 200 frames (totalling 5 seconds) and 8 FPS for 41 frames (totalling 5 seconds as well). The PAR is 0.5. Each frame shows the frame number, the time stamp in millisecond accuracy, and a moving cross target with its corresponding pixel coordinates. 

To run the [](create.jl) script you'll need to install `mp4fpsmod` from https://github.com/nu774/mp4fpsmod.
